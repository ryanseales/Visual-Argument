Initially my topic was going to be related to the music industry, but instead I decided to head in a slightly more creative direction. I want to make the argument that art transcends space and time and is a universal force that brings people together. My image is in a very rough stage currently, but I envision a beautiful landscape with a bunch of silhouette figures doing various types of art.
