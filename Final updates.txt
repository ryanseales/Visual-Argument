For my final draft of the visual argument project, I made some slight changes. I added a few more silhouette figures and configured them in a way to show 3d space and depth. I chose to have a few people in the image performing art (one of them is painting and the other two are playing music). The main argument of my image is that art transcends space and time and also is a unifying force between people. I represented this by choosing an astral looking setting with a barrier between the ground + sky and space. There are two figures meditating rising into the space portion of my image. The top one is distorted with a wave effect. This was to show the transcendental aspect of art and how it goes beyond space and time. The two people laying on the ground observing the art represent the unifying aspect. How they are there to observe art and as a consequence it brings them together. I knew this message wouldn’t be entirely clear without some kind of text, but I also didn’t want to explain the meaning too much in the image. I settled with simply writing “art transcends” in the center. I left it at this because it implies that art transcends many things; space, time, cultural boundaries, language etc. I wanted to keep the text general to include all of these concepts that art transcends. From a technical standpoint, I used the transform tool a lot to shape and size things how I wanted, made use of a border, blended layers together using paint, scissors tool, etc.
